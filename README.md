## Now a important thing
#### I know guys that the site is super slow, and the reason is I used svg to create the facinating sections where I could just use css to color those. That's a mistake or problem which I will solve later on. 🙏🙏🙏

#### You seen my code, if not then go, now you have gotten so much mistakes or reasons to blame me, RIGHT ???
